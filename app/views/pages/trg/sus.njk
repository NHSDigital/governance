        <h2>What is the role of the Sustainability CCC?</h2>
        <p>The Sustainability CCC is concerned with ensuring submissions have duly considered the climate and organisational impact of the proposed change.</p>
        <p>This would include ensuring that services are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Right-sized for their utilisation, for instance by using serverless cloud compute.</li>
        <li>Adopting higher-tier services where possible, indicating a preference for SaaS, PaaS over IaaS.</li>
         <li>Considering and documenting the CO2 impact of service design choices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is recommended to engage with the Sustainability CCC as early as possible in the process of drafting your TRG submission.</p>
        <h3>What evidence will they be looking for in your submission?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How have you designed the service to ensure optimal resource utilisation?</li>
            <li>If you are using IaaS tier services, have you articulated why SaaS or PaaS options are not available?</li>
            <li>If you are using NHS-managed infrastructure, have you documented the CO2 impact of doing so?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Criteria / Areas of Concern</h3>
        <p><Those marked by * also relate to physical infrastructure (including end-user devices)

        <ul>

<li>CO2 Assessment *: We need to define a process for this, but the core focus here will be on the colo facilities, but also on ensuring that services are designed such that they don't force adoption of CO2-expensive hardware (ie, smart phones)</li>
<li>CoTS Preference: This looks for evidence that we considered SaaS solutions first, then PaaS, then existing commercial offerings and only as a last resort do we build it ourselves. </li>
<li>Right-sized Services *:  This relates to ensuring that the compute, memory & storage footprint for a service is reasonably balanced. Taking this to an absolute minimum, whilst ideal, also creates potential service risks. Hence, the 'reasonable' element.  In cloud-architectures, this is going to be focused on use of things like auto-scaling, and just-in-time provisioning.</li>
<li>Appropriate Services *: This looks at the operating hours and availability levels of the service, with the focus on ensuring that services run-dark when they are not in use. For example, development environments being powered-off outside of working hours. The availability focus is on ensuring that resilience and high-availability are implemented only where required, and in ways which minimise the active footprint.</li>
<li>Efficient Data: This evaluates whether the transfer, storage and consumption of data are properly optimised. For example, ensuring that stored data assets are presented in a columnar format for analysis.</li>
