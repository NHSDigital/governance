        <h2 id="the-role-of-trg">The role of TRG</h2>
        <p>TRG is the Technical Review and Governance group and is made up of technical experts from across our organisation. It meets every first and third Wednesday each month.</p>
        <p>TRG provides technical governance by ensuring that all developments and activities align to published policies, principles, patterns and standards.</p>
        <p>The Enterprise Architecture Board (EAB) oversees four design authorities who are responsible for maintaining those policies and standards:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/governance/bida">BIDA - Business Interoperability Design Authority</a></li>
          <li><a href="/governance/aida">AIDA - Applications and Infrastructure Design Authority</a></li>
          <li><a href="/governance/dda">DDA Data Design Authority</a></li>
          <li><a href="/governance/cda">CDA The newly formed Cyber Design Authority</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Where those examples of good practice may not yet exist, TRG will highlight the need to the appropriate design authority, and in the meantime will review proposed architectural decisions.</p>
        <p>The Live Services Board looks to TRG. If programmes have not been to TRG they will not be supported in going live. As a technical and/or project professional working on a new programme or project, it therefore makes sense to engage with TRG at an early stage.</p>

        <h2>Taking something through the TRG</h2>
        <p>We are required, by the Government, to provide fully audited and traceable governance of all the services we at NHS Digital deliver. TRG is how we do this for technology.
          The role of the TRG is to provide technical reviews and governance across the delivery lifecycle of all NHS Digital projects. We ensure that the right criteria are being met
          (principles, strategies, policies, standards and guidance) at every step of the way from Discovery stage to Go Live.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The TRG are not there to increase workload or complexity – rather the opposite.
          We ensure scalability and flexibility but with the necessary controls.</li>
          <li>This process helps make sure the right decisions are being made at the right time.
          Protecting public spending and providing a level of confidence in the programmes
          being launched to reduce risk of failure.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What do I need to take to TRG?</h2>
        <p>All works (programmes, projects or other initiatives) which lead to a change to the systems and services impacting technology need to have TRG consideration.
        Identifying where there is a need for TRG involvement and ensuring that the right information is provided early on avoids any potential for delays or misunderstandings
        later. It also ensures that each of the CCCs have the information they need at the right time.</p>

        <h3>Examples of work that would require TRG engagement</h3>
        <p>New solution designs, from concept to physical design process, cloud infrastructure
        requests and code-in-the-open submissions. TRG is also there to review current long-term,
        large scale programmes against PPPS (Principles, Policies, Patterns and Standards).
        The checklist is frequently updated as part of our continual improvement process, so
        please always look at the latest version.</p>

        <h3>What don’t I need to take to the TRG?</h3>
        <p>However there are many things (applications, standards, tech stacks) which will have
        already been approved and published as “Preferred” or “Strategic”. In these cases, you
        won’t need to present them for review, you just have to simply declare you are using them.
        You can access a list of everything TRG has approved in <a href="https://aalto.digital.nhs.uk/#/dashboard?library=5464c07f-daf1-4eee-b9b6-22e6c4dfbbd0">Aalto</a></p>

        <h3>TRG meeting attendance</h3>
        <p>We would like to see people attend the formal TRG meetings by exception only.</p>

        <h3>What is my responsibility with CCCs?</h3>
        <p>All submissions will be made via the EA portal and these will be visible to those
        responsible for each of the cross-cutting concerns (CCCs).</p>

        <h4>There are eight CCCs</h4>
        <p>Data, Development, Infrastructure, Interoperability, Live Services SM, Security, Solution Assurance and Usability and Accessibility.</p>
        <p>We would recommend that you engage each CCC that is relevant to your project as early as possible in the process of writing your submission.</p>
        <p>With the benefit of their experience, they may be able to save both time and investment as they have visibility of all projects going through the TRG. They can identify duplication in current submissions that may provide learning for your own project and will know if a similar solution has already been designed to meet the same objective(s).</p>
