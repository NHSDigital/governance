    <h2>Platform and Infrastructure</h2>
    <p>At present 30+ infrastructure platforms exist across NHS Digital. In an effort to bring
together new thinking and current initiatives, we have developed the <a href="https://hscic365.sharepoint.com/Platforms_and_Infrastructure/Pages/Platform-Strategy.aspx"> Infrastructure
Platform Strategy.</a></p>
  
  <h3>Does this apply to me?</h3>
The strategy applies to anyone involved in the creation, delivery or governance of
programmes, services and applications that require hosting. This includes:
<ul>
<li>All new systems and services delivered in house including Spine and eRS
(but excludes wholesale outsourced systems such as NHS Mail)
<li>Any existing services where it would make sense to re-evaluate the hosting
arrangements e.g contract break-points, where a significant issue exists or where
it would be more cost effective to change.
</ul>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<ul>
<li>This strategy promotes the vision to make it easier, cheaper and faster for
programmes to securely host their systems and services.
</ul>

<h3>What does the Infrastructure Platform Strategy cover?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Creation of a single platform function
<li>Embracing the Government’s Public Cloud First Policy
<li>Delivering a strategic NHS Digital Public Cloud
<li>Adoption of the ‘Where to host’ policy
<li>Adoption of the NHS Digital Data Security Risk Method
<li>Confirming Microsoft Azure and AWS as our strategic cloud partners
<li>Confirming Crown Hosting as our strategic co-location partner
</ol>
<h3>What role do the TRG have in this strategy?
<ul>
<li>The TRG are responsible for ensuring the
strategy and its related policies are adhered to.
If your programme moves away from what is
outlined, you will require TRG approval.
</ul>
