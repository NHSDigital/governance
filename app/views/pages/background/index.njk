    <h2 id="the-role-of-trg">The role of TRG</h2>
    <p>TRG is the Technical Review and Governance group and is made up of technical experts from across our organisation. It meets every first and third Wednesday each month.</p>
    <p>TRG provides technical governance by ensuring that all developments and activities align to published policies, principles, patterns and standards.</p>
    <p>The Enterprise Architecture Board (EAB) oversees four design authorities who are responsible for maintaining those policies and standards:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/governance/bida">BIDA - Business Interoperability Design Authority</a></li>
      <li><a href="/governance/aida">AIDA - Applications and Infrastructure Design Authority</a></li>
      <li><a href="/governance/dda">DDA Data Design Authority</a></li>
      <li><a href="/governance/cda">CDA The newly formed Cyber Design Authority</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where those examples of good practice may not yet exist, TRG will highlight the need to the appropriate design authority, and in the meantime will review proposed architectural decisions.</p>
    <p>The Live Services Board looks to TRG. If programmes have not been to TRG they will not be supported in going live. As a technical and/or project professional working on a new programme or project, it therefore makes sense to engage with TRG at an early stage.</p>

    <h2 id="how-this-manual-could-help-you">How this manual could help you</h2>
    <p>As a Technical Architect or Project lead:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You need the most current and relevant information and content to ensure you can deliver effectively</li>
      <li>You need to understand the correct governance processes you need to follow and who you can speak to for help and support</li>
      <li>Most importantly you need to be able to see what has already been done; pre-approved standards, policies and principles to form application development and architectural decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The result?</strong> You can develop and launch projects faster and more efficiently to improve the lives of patients, clinicians and NHS workers. Ensuring public money doesnâ€™t get wasted through duplicating efforts and creating a documented audit trail of your governance journey.</p>
